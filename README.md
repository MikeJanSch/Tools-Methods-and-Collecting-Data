Topic Title: Media Propaganda

# Context for the topic - there's no current research yet

# Theoretical part: scientific articles on the subject

# Interpretive part: analyzing the telegram channels using propaganda techniques - yet too broad

# RQ2: How the growth of reading activity and the national composition of the audience in Russian speaking segment of Telegram correlate?

# RQ3: Can the Ukraine war topic on Telegram attract more audiences? What type of audiences this topic attract?

# RQ4: Distinguishing propagansistic content can be demanding in terms of numerous indicators needed for a broader picture. still - how indicators of Russian speaking channels of Telegram are linked to war topic? What connotation - negative, positive, neutral - is used for propagandistic content creation?
